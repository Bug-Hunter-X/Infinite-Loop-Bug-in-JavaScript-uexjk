This repository contains a simple JavaScript program that demonstrates a common coding error: an infinite loop caused by a missing increment in a `while` loop. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of careful attention to loop control variables to prevent unexpected behavior and program crashes.
